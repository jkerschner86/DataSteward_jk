There is 1 PDF that contains contains documentation, design, verification and a Hitchhiker's Guide

-- Phaidra_Metadata_License_Auditor.pdf
(The chapter "The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Phaidra Auditor (Logic Map)" contains references to Douglas Adams, Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)


and 2 Python files containing code. They both have the same functionality, but one is serious, the other contains a towel.

-- 2_5_Assignement_v06.py
For the bureaucrats

-- 2_5_Assignement_HitchhikersGuide.py
For the busy people
Towel included
(This file is a more humorous approach and was lightly altered with the help of Google Gemini, to more resemble Douglas Adams Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)
